Project Overview:

This project aims to predict housing prices in Boston using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the Boston Housing dataset, which contains various features influencing house prices.

Objectives:

Understand the key factors affecting house prices in Boston.
Preprocess and analyze the dataset for meaningful insights.
Build a regression model to predict house prices.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values
Normalize and scale features
Encode categorical variables
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize feature relationships with the target variable
Identify correlations and outliers
Model Training and Evaluation
Split the data into training and test sets
Train various regression models including:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Evaluate models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score

Results and Discussion:

The Random Forest Regressor provided the best performance with the lowest error and highest accuracy.
Important features affecting house prices include RM, LSTAT, and PTRATIO.
The model can be further improved with hyperparameter tuning and additional feature engineering.

Conclusion:

This project successfully implemented a machine learning approach to predict Boston housing prices. Future improvements can include:

Experimenting with deep learning models.
Incorporating additional external factors such as economic indicators.
Using feature selection techniques for better model performance.
